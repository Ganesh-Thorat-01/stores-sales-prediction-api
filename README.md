# Problem statement
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data
warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.


# Project is handled in a structured way with modular coding.

# Dataset Description 
BigMart has collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Where the dataset consists of 12 attributes like Item Fat, Item Type, Item MRP, Outlet Type, Item Visibility, Item Weight, Outlet Identifier, Outlet Size, Outlet Establishment Year, Outlet Location Type, Item Identifier and Item Outlet Sales. Out of these attributes target variable is the Item Outlet Sales attribute and remaining attributes are refer as independent variables. 
The data-set is also based on hypotheses of store level and product level. Where store level involves attributes like: city, population density, store capacity, location, etc and the product level hypotheses involves attributes like: brand, advertisement, promotional offer, etc.
